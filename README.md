# Style Dictionary Starter

This repository serves as a starter project for using [Style Dictionary](https://v4.styledictionary.com) to generate platform-specific design tokens. The goal is to help you quickly get up and running with design tokens that can be transformed into CSS custom properties, Sass variables, or other formats to maintain consistency across your projects.
