# Design Tokens Workflow Series

Welcome to the Design Tokens Workflow Series! 

This series of articles explores various aspects of Design Tokens and how to effectively use Style Dictionary in your projects.

The goal is to help you quickly get up and running with design tokens that can be transformed into CSS custom properties, Sass variables, or other formats to maintain consistency across your projects.

Each article is structured as its own branch in this repository.
